## Abstract
In the highly competitive telecommunications industry, where customer retention is crucial for maintaining stability and driving growth, churn prediction emerges as a critical factor. This research focuses on proposing advanced machine learning algorithms to effectively predict a customer's likelihood of churning, based on an extensive analysis of behavioral data collected over a three-month period. The dataset encompasses key metrics such as call frequencies (both inbound and outbound), data usage across 3G and 2G networks, recharge amounts, duration of service with the provider, average monthly revenue per user, and other relevant factors.

To address the challenge of churn prediction, machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are employed. Each model's performance is meticulously evaluated to determine the most suitable approach for identifying potential churners. This research not only aims to enhance the accuracy of predictions across various algorithms but also seeks to support data-driven decision-making processes for optimizing customer retention strategies
